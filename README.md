# C++ ELzero Bootcamp

This repository contains solutions and practice tasks for the C++ ELzero bootcamp.

## Repository Structure

The project is organized into weekly folders. Each folder contains one or more `.cpp` source files for the tasks:

- `control-flow-week5/` — Control flow exercises (if/else, `switch`, etc.).
- `array-week6/` — Array-related exercises.
- `loops-week7/` — Loop exercises.
- `functio-week8/` — Function-related exercises (folder name kept as-is).

There may also be small helper files such as `tempCodeRunnerFile.cpp` added by the editor.

## Build & Run

You can compile and run any single task with a C++ compiler. Examples below assume `g++` (MinGW on Windows or GCC on Linux/macOS):

From the folder that contains the source file:

```bash
g++ -g task-1.cpp -o task-1.exe    # compile (Windows/Mingw)
.\task-1.exe                       # run on PowerShell/CMD
```

Or on Unix-like shells (Git Bash, WSL):

```bash
g++ -g task-1.cpp -o task-1
./task-1
```

VS Code: a build task is included (auto-generated by the C++ extension). Run the task named:

`C/C++: g++.exe build active file`

This will compile the currently active file and place the executable next to it.

## Notes

- Use the debugger or add `std::cout` statements to inspect program behavior.
- Filenames and folder names are used as-is; if you rename folders, update references accordingly.

## Requirements

- C++ compiler (GCC/Clang/MSVC)
- Optional: VS Code with the C/C++ extension for an integrated build/debug experience

---

If you'd like, I can also:

- Add a CONTRIBUTING section or a short script to build all tasks.
- Correct the `functio-week8` folder name to `function-week8` and update references.
